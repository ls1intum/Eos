# JavaFX Exercise

1. [task][Button Functionality](testInput())
   Implement the button's click behavior so that when it's clicked, the label displays the number of characters entered in the input field.  
   Hint: You can use `countButton.setOnAction()` to set up the event handler.

2. [task][Consistent Layout](testLayout())
   Ensure that the overall user interface is clean and visually consistent. All elements should be neatly aligned vertically for a tidy look.
